            <p>Hello! I’m Ashish Ashok Khetal, a Master’s student in Computer Applications with a keen interest in artificial intelligence (AI) systems in games. My current research focuses on the application of AI techniques to enhance game design, player experiences, and overall gameplay dynamics.</p>
            <p>As a student passionate about both technology and gaming, I am exploring how advanced AI systems can be integrated into video games to create more realistic and engaging interactions. My research aims to investigate how AI can improve non-player character (NPC) behaviors, adapt game difficulty dynamically, and enhance procedural content generation.</p>
            <p>Outside of my research, I enjoy playing and analyzing games, experimenting with new technologies, and staying updated with the latest advancements in AI. This blog is a space where I share insights from my research, discuss emerging trends in AI and gaming, and provide a glimpse into the fascinating intersection of these fields.</p>
            <p>I hope you find the content here both informative and inspiring. Feel free to connect if you share similar interests or have any questions about AI in games!</p>
